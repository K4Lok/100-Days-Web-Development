# Frontend JavaScript Frameworks
> A JavaScript framwork is a collection of JavaScript code library that helps developers to be more productive and makes the code base more structured and readable.

## Why using Frameworks
> Pure JavaScript can be so complicated and messy when the project scales, we have to manage every DOM element on our own when we need to update or delete the element. 
The frontend framework can help us finish the boring procedures behind the scenes and let us focus on what is matter.

## Imperative Programming
> It's the approach of coding where you spell out all the steps to implement your goal, you show the flows of your steps on how to finish a task.

## Declarative Programming
> It's also a way of thinking of coding, you will hide mostly the steps and only display what you want to implement. In short, you abstract the steps into a readable function name and implement the goal.

## Differences
> Both of them achieve the same goal, but with different approach of showing in the code project. 
And when we're using the frontend framework, it's more likely we're using the declarative approach where the framework will help tackle the steps for you.
