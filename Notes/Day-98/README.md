# Frontend JavaScript Frameworks
> A JavaScript framwork is a collection of JavaScript code library that helps developers to be more productive and makes the code base more structured and readable.

## Why using Frameworks
> Pure JavaScript can be so complicated and messy when the project scales, we have to manage every DOM element on our own when we need to update or delete the element. 
The frontend framework can help us finish the boring procedures behind the scenes and let us focus on what is matter.
