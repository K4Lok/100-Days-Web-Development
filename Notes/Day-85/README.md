## Online Shop
> We can now prepare the admin routes and views for managing the products and orders. Basically, create the views and routes for submitting the forms data so that we can add products info to the database.

# Admin Routes
> In admin routes, we have two pages

1) Manage Products: CRUD the products in database.
2) Manage Orders: manage the orders made by the client (normal user).

## Manage Products
> This page should show all the available products in the database and have a function to add new product.

We will do the Fetching and items styling later on.

## Add New Product
> I've created a form for submitting the product information, but not yet create the connection and model for the table yet.
