# Deploy a Website
> With the previous knowledges for hosting a website, we can now try hosting a dynamic website reply on database services with limited functionality on Heroku and MongoDB Atlas.

## Optimize the Website Performance
> We can monitoring and analyzing the performance of the web application and identifying ways to improve it, by the following perspectives.

1. Image optimization (Shrink it)
2. Minify CSS and Javascript files
3. Reduce the HTTP requests

## Static Websites
> There're many static web hosting services online which could help hosting our static website easily.

## Dynamic Websites
> It's much more complex since it involved with backend which is the server-side and the database. Therefore we need more then just a static web hosting service. 
### Node.js Hosting
> In our case, we can find any nodejs hosting service online and try it out. Heroku is quite popular tho.

### MongoDB Services
> For the Mongo database, we can also seek helps from others company instead of hosting a database server on our own. We can try out the MongoDB Atlas.

# Web Services / APIs / Traditional Website
> Here's the notes for why and when to use Web Services and APIs. Web Services and APIs can perform actions / provide data that not exclusively on HTML and JavaScript, we can interchange the data with other programming language or scripts. As mentioned previously, we can't build all the features on our own, it's not efficient and making things tedious by reinventing the wheels.

## JavaScript Packages APIs vs URL-based APIs
> API is a general terms for describing a bridge for two application to exchange data. Therefore APIs can be in different form, like Stripe package we used for online payment services, it's a package with methods to perform actions and exchange data. But for the widely used approach is the URL-based API, where it can manipulate data based on the URL and different types of request.

## APIs vs Traditional Websites
> When should we use APIs over showing the content as the HTML form? This is relatively simple, just consider the data is used by multiple website or not, it would be better to write an API to get access to the data for multiple application.
